secret-bridge
==============

A bridge to help increase your ability to detect secrets shared on Github.

More details on the methodology can be found in our [blog post](https://duo.com/labs/research/how-to-monitor-github-for-secrets).

How It Works
============

There are two ways this can operate:

-	**Event Polling** - In this mode, the script polls the [Github Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/) for an organization, developer, or set or repositories. This is useful when you may not have control over the thing you're watching.
-	**Webhook** - In this mode, the script sets up a server which can receive webhook events. This is useful when you have control over the thing you're watching, since it provides data in near real-time.

Once events are received indicating that new code has been pushed, this script executes configured *detectors* to detect secrets in the changes. At this time, the following detectors are supported:

-	[`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)
-	[`git-secrets`](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)

A more general listing of tools which can be used to detect secrets in Git repositories can be found in [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)

If a secret is found, it is sent upstream to a *notifier*. At this time, we support notifying both via stdout as well as Slack and Microsoft Teams.

Installation
============

Via Docker
----------

The easiest way to get started is by using our Docker image. You can see how to run the Docker image in the [Usage section](#running-via-docker).


Installation from Source
------------------------

First, you need to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/duo-labs/secret-bridge.git
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configuration
=============

Configuration is done through `config.toml`. In this file, you set your `access_token`, the organizations, developers, and repositories you want to monitor for secrets, and more.

Setting Up the Access Token
---------------------------

You may wish to avoid having the access token in a file. Instead, you can set this value to `env`, and put the access token in the `GITHUB_WATCHER_TOKEN` environment variable.

Setting Up the Monitors
-----------------------

If you're monitoring via event polling (as opposed to using the webhook server), then you can configure what to monitor via the `monitors` configuration value.

You have the option of configuring one or more Github organization, user, or repository.

Setting Up the Detectors
------------------------

This tool doesn't actually implement secret detection for Git repositories, since we consider that largely a solved problem. Instead, we handle running various secret detection tools for you in near real-time.

Detectors are configured via the `detectors` configuration value. Right now, the following values are accepted:

-	`detect-secrets`
-	`git-secrets`

> Note: It's expected that the detector you use is installed and available on your `$PATH`. If you are running this via the Docker image, all the required tools are pre-installed.

Setting Up the Notifiers
------------------------

If a secret is detected, we will notify you using your configured `notifiers`. Currently, the two notification methods are printing to the console, and notifying via a Slack/Teams webhook. 

For webhook notifications, both Slack and Microsoft Teams implementations work identically: the JSON structure used to call the Slack webhook is the same as for Microsoft Teams, the implementation is just currently not updated to reflect this. To configure Teams notifications, follow these same steps but with a Teams Connector.

To configure Slack/Teams notifications, create the following configuration option with the `webhook_url` provided by Slack:

```toml
[notifiers.slack_webhook]
    webhook_url='your_webhook_url'
```

Usage
=====

```
python main.py --help
Usage: main.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -f, --config PATH  [default: config.toml]
  -v, --verbose      Print verbose debug information
  --help             Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  poll
  webhook
```

Running Via Docker
------------------

```
docker run -ti --rm -e GITHUB_WATCHER_TOKEN=your_access_token duolabs/secret-bridge poll
```

*Note that this is the only docker command needed to get the tool up and running. Relevant images will be automatically pulled if they are not found locally.*
